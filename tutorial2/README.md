### Tutorial 2

In tutorial 1, we used html "div" tags to create objects in the browser that we could format, shape and move. You can also create then from code. The helper function **Sprite.create** and **Backdrop.create**, create div tags and add them to the html document. Below is the minimum tags required to create a simple app.


[demo here](https://gormanlearncode.github.io/learncode/tutorial2/)

```html

<!-- You must have html tag, body tag and a script tag. This has 2 script tags,
     one for e helperfunctions and one for the main program-->
<!doctype html>
<body>
    <h1>Tutorial 2</h1>
    <p>Minimal HTML and CSS. See how you can do almost everything from code.</p>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://tinyurl.com/462k3dx7"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

```
This is a minimal program, that creates a sprite (div) and created a backdrop (div). Then adds the sprite to the backdrop and moves it to the position 100x100. By using the "create functions, we donâ€™t have to have the div's defined in our HTML or CSS. This is just a way of adding them to the html document programmatically. The code is wrapped in an **async** function call run. This allows the "await" statement to be called on the asynchronous **Controls.wait** function.
```javascript
console.log("start");
async function run(){
     var sprite = Sprite.create({image:"images/squirrel.png",width:100,height:100});
     var backdrop = Backdrop.create({backgroundColor:"yellow",width:800,height:400});
     backdrop.addSprite(sprite);
     for(let i=0;i<20;i++)
     {
          let x=100+i*10;
          sprite.moveTo(x,100);
          await Controls.wait(100);
     }
     console.log("end");
}
run();
```
Try creating this app yourself. In your github repository create new files as follow:
1) name = **tutorial/index.html** with the html above.
2) name = **tutorial/main.html** with the javascript above.
3) name = **images/README.md** you can check this in empty. It is just to create the images directory.
4) Upload into the images directory, a file named = **squirrel.png** you can download my image from [here](https://gormanlearncode.github.io/learncode/tutorial2/images/squirrel.png) and upload it to your github.

### Please explain?

You have created an app that has minimal html and no css. You have seen that **div** objects can be injected into the html document from code.
