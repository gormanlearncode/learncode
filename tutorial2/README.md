### Tutorial 2

In tutorial 1, we used html "div" tags to create objects in the browser that we could format, shape and move. You can also create then from code. The helper function **Sprite.create** and **Backdrop.create**, create div tags and add them to the html document. Below is the minimum tags required to create a simple app.


[demo here](https://gormanlearncode.github.io/learncode/tutorial2/)

```html

<!-- You must have html tag, body tag and a script tag. This has 2 script tags,
     one for e helperfunctions and one for the main program-->
<!doctype html>
<body>
    <h1>Tutorial 2</h1>
    <p>Minimal HTML and CSS. See how you can do almost everything from code.</p>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://tinyurl.com/462k3dx7"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

```
This is a minimal program, that creates a sprite (div) and created a backdrop (div). Then adds the sprite to the backdrop and moves it to the position 100x100. By using the "create functions, we donâ€™t have to have the div's defined in our HTML or CSS. This is just a way of adding them to the html document programmatically. 

```javascript
console.log("start");
var sprite = Sprite.create({image:"images/squirrel.png",width:100,height:100});
var backdrop = Backdrop.create({backgroundColor:"yellow",width:800,height:400});
backdrop.addSprite(sprite);
sprite.moveTo(100,100);
await Controld.wait(1000);
sprite.moveTo(200,100);
console.log("end");
```
