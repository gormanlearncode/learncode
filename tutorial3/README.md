### Tutorial 3

In tutorial 2, we made a simple app. Below takes that a step further, adding a button programmatically, without helper code.


[demo here](https://gormanlearncode.github.io/learncode/tutorial3/)

```html

<!-- You must have html tag, body tag and a script tag. This has 2 script tags,
     one for e helperfunctions and one for the main program-->
<!doctype html>
<body>
    <h1>Tutorial 3</h1>
    <p>Minimal HTML and CSS. See how you can do almost everything from code.</p>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://tinyurl.com/462k3dx7"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

```
This is a minimal program, that creates a sprite (div) and created a backdrop (div). Then adds the sprite to the backdrop and moves it to the position 100x100. By using the "create functions, we donâ€™t have to have the div's defined in our HTML or CSS. This is just a way of adding them to the html document programmatically. The code is wrapped in an **async** function call run. This allows the "await" statement to be called on the asynchronous **Controls.wait** function.
```javascript
console.log("start");
var sprite = Sprite.create({image:"images/squirrel.png",width:100,height:100});
var backdrop = Backdrop.create({backgroundColor:"yellow",width:800,height:400});
backdrop.addSprite(sprite);
async function run(){
     for(let i=0;i<10;i++)
     {
          let x=100+i*10;
          sprite.moveTo(x,100);
          await Controls.wait(100);
     }
     console.log("end");
}
let button1=document.createElement("button");
document.innerText="RUN";
document.body.append(button1);
button1.onclick=run;

```
Try creating this app yourself. In your github repository create new files as follow:
1) name = **tutorial/index.html** with the html above.
2) name = **tutorial/main.html** with the javascript above.
3) name = **images/README.md** you can check this in empty. It is just to create the images directory.
4) Upload into the images directory, a file named = **squirrel.png** you can download my image from [here](https://gormanlearncode.github.io/learncode/tutorial2/images/squirrel.png) and upload it to your github.

### Please explain?
This is the same as adding this to the html. \<button\>\</button\>
```javascript
document.createElement("button")
```
This changes adds a name to the button like this \<button\>RUN\</button\>
```javascript
document.innerText="RUN";
```
This adds the generated html to the actual html document (at the end before \</body\> tag)
```javascript
document.body.append(button1);
```
This assign a function to call when the button is pressed.
```javascript
button1.onclick=run;
```
Notice that I moved the below, outside the run() function. Otherwise they would not be called until the button is pressed.
```javascript
var sprite = Sprite.create({image:"images/squirrel.png",width:100,height:100});
var backdrop = Backdrop.create({backgroundColor:"yellow",width:800,height:400});
backdrop.addSprite(sprite);
```
